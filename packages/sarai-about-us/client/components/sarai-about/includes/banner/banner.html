		Project SARAI (Smarter Approaches to Reinvigorate Agriculture as an Industry in the Philippines) is an action-research program, funded by the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development (DOST-PCAARRD), working towards reducing climate risks by providing agricultural stakeholders with site-specific crop advisories.
		<br/><br/>
		It anchors on sustainability through multi-level partnerships starting from farming communities up to national agencies. In 2021, the ultimate goal is to have established regional and community-level SARAI hubs where farmers can easily go to for up-to-date information, and to report initial farm conditions.
