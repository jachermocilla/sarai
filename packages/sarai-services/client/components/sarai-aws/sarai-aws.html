            <span style="font-size:medium">AWS is an instrument used in measuring and monitoring real-time local weather parameters such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind velocity. The AWS is also capable of weather forecasting, and can be used as an early warning system (EWS). Weather forecast and information obtained from an AWS can help farmers in making appropriate decisions related to crop planting dates, and adjustments in farm operations. The AWS network also serves as a data point collection source for Project SARAI to help build its long-term weather and climate databases.<br/><br/>

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)<br/><br/>

UAV also known as drones is used for various monitoring activities. The adoption of this technology significantly enhances risk and damage assessments, and creates a strategy to prepare for and respond ti potential disasters that can affect the livelihood of farmers. The drone is equipped with navigation and photogrammetric equipment that generates data-rich maps from aerial photographs, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and graphical indicators used to assess crop health.<br/><br/>
