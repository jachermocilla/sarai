            <span style="font-size:medium">WAISS is a spreadsheet-based model that simulates soil moisture deficit in crop fields. Soil and irrigation data, daily weather data, and crop data are used as inputs for WAISS that incorporates the FAO Penman-Monteith Equation and Soil Water Balance Equation in its calculations.<br/><br/>

            Cost-efficient Soil Moisture Monitoring System (CSMS)<br/><br/>

            The CSMS consists of an Arduino-based soil moisture meter and a set of soil sensors composed of fabricated gypsum blocks. The system can be produced easily out of locally-available and affordable materials to provide farmers easier access to this technology.
